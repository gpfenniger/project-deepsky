**Purpose :**
To build a game in Java that builds upon
my previous knowledge in school and my personal
studies. Project Deepsky is an effort to 
make my own version of a fly by science fiction
game. The goal is to fly around, fight, trade
and complete missions that have visible and lasting
impacts within a complex game world. While
simple in game logic and visuals this project
hopes to evoke lasting impressions through
creative story telling.


## Game Mechanics

### Explore

Explore fantastic regions across the galaxy
encountering dozens of alien species and worlds.
Fly around sprawling galactic empires as well
as lone rangers making their way on the space
frontier.

### Trade

Buy and sell commodities and ships across
space to make a profit. Each system has its
own tech level and prices.

### Fight

Fight for yourself, massive star empires or even
rebel groups as you seek to establish yourself 
in an ever growing world. As the game goes on
more dangerous and threatining groups will arise
to create instability.

### Chapter 1

The start of the game follows the Terran
Republic slowly making its way out into the
stars. Having several small colonies they
do not expect to find anyone out there in
the great depths of space. The player is a lone
fighter pilot who is among those chosen to 
explore new areas.

When the Terran Republic encounters the Volda
Empire it is a slaughter waiting to happen. 
They player can choose between fighting off the
Empire or bringing your fellow Terrans into their
fold.
